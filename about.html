            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Kess Flanery. I'm a student at KSU studying Cybersecurity, and I have always been fascinated by technology and coding. I got into programming because I wanted to know how games were made, and soon after, I realized the broader possibilities technology offers.</p>
            
            <p>Over the years, I’ve gained hands-on experience in several programming languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. My work is focused on cybersecurity and building web applications that not only look good but also protect user data.</p>
